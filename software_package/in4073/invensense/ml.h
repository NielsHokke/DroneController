 *  @brief  Motion Library APIs.
 *          The Motion Library processes gyroscopes, accelerometers, and
 *          compasses to provide a physical model of the movement for the
 *          sensors.
 *          The results of this processing may be used to control objects
 *          within a user interface environment, detect gestures, track 3D
 *          movement for gaming applications, and analyze the blur created
 *          due to hand movement while taking a picture.
